# hello-world
my first steps
i like fried chicken but i eat a lot of vegetables!
sare ra!yenna pannira?
no more.I plan on becoming a vegan from now onwards!


aside from food I like watching movies.But now I am more interested in completing this specialised course.I felt happy when I was
able to complete the r programming course.I was also happy with the fact that my code was running well.so programming is fun and sometimes you feel very happy when you sit for long hours and then get the code working.
